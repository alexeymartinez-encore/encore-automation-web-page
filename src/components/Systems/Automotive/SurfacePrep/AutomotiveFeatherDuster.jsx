        desc="Encore specializes in engineering and designing standard machines and
          robot-mounted assemblies, offering a wide range of custom blow-off
          systems for various vehicle and product sizes. These systems use
          high-velocity, often electrostatically charged air to remove dirt and
          particles from surfaces before painting. Options include stationary or
          robotic configurations, high/low volume and velocity air, compressed
          or fan-driven air, PC or PLC-based visualization systems with
          graphical user interfaces, and clean wall or in-booth designs.
          Additionally, dirt collection can be managed via vacuum or booth
          collection systems."

          surfaces before the final paint layer is applied. This process enhances paint adhesion, ensures uniform coverage,
          and provides protection against corrosion, increasing the vehicle's durability and finish quality.
          Primer application is typically automated to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and consistent quality across 
          the vehicle's surfaces."

    text: "Encore offers a wide variety of custom blow off systems, engineered and designed to meet the diverse needs of various vehicle and product sizes. These systems utilize air, often electrostatically charged, to remove dirt and foreign particles from surfaces prior to painting. Available options for blow off systems include stationary (fixed) or machine/robotic configurations, various sizes and complexities in machine setups, high/low volume and high/low velocity air options, and compressed or fan-driven air systems. They also feature PC-based or PLC-based visualization systems, PLC-based with PC or Panel view Graphical User Interfaces, clean wall or in-booth design, and vacuum or booth collection of dirt. Key features of Encore’s standard product solutions include sealed-for-life bearings, multi-axis servo motors with intelligent drives, integrated resolvers for accurate position feedback, and monitoring of the de-static bar. Additionally, they offer PLC-based systems with PC or Panel view Graphical User Interfaces, adjustable roller rotation speed (20-80 RPM), overhead beams with collision avoidance photo eyes, and systems that do not require compressed air. Encore’s products can also be combined with blow off systems for more effective cleaning, integrating both feather dusters and blow off sections.",

      "In addition to blow off systems, Encore offers custom feather duster systems for a wide range of vehicle and product sizes. These systems range from full robotic feather dusters with optional integrated hoods to floor-mounted hood assemblies. Encore's standard fixed machines can be provided in clean wall or in-booth design with servo-controlled articulating axes or manually adjusted fixed machines. The combination of robotic and fixed machine feather dusting systems provides flexible solutions for complex requirements. Encore manufactures all Ostrich feather rolls in-house for their systems, as well as replacement feather rolls for existing feather duster systems.",

The linear brush, part of the Sword Brush assembly, operates around the outer contours of its sword-like shape, effectively wiping crosswise over the subject surface to remove particles and dust. These brushes, manufactured by Wandres in the southern Black Forest, boast a long industrial life and are suitable for 24/7 use.",
    subText:
      "The contact area of the linear brush is flexibly mounted on a pneumatically regulated pressure buffer, allowing it to compensate for uneven surfaces and material thickness variations of up to +/- 2 mm. During continuous operations, a self-cleaning unit regenerates the brushes, using a rotating rack and compressed air nozzles to detach particles both mechanically and pneumatically. These loose particles are then immediately disposed of by a suction system, ensuring efficient and uninterrupted production.",

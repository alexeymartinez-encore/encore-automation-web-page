            Encore Automation was founded in 2006 by a core group of specialists
            from Haden Automation Group and AEG Paint Systems, bringing years of
            expertise in automation. In 2014, we became part of the Taikisha
            Group, enhancing our global presence and capabilities. Known for
            installing 90% of the worldâ€™s automotive powder prime systems, we
            have successfully integrated thousands of robots, bell stations, and
            vision systems. Our innovations extend to automated defect
            detection, sealer and LASD cells, Pur-foam systems, marking, and
            surface preparation, making us leaders in advanced automation
            solutions.
